## Hi, I'm Jonas <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm a German/Jordanian theoretical physics msci student at Imperial College London. I'm excited about all things tech and science. Currently especially fascinated by deep reinforcement learning, meta learning and computational performance optimization.

### :computer: Projects
:mortar_board: Currently, I am working on my Master's project in computational linguistics (for which you can check out my work [here.](https://github.com/jonas-scholz123/msci-project) :warning: Some parts are work in progress and exploratory!:warning:)

:santa: Over the holidays, I've been learning some efficient low-level languages, mainly improving my C++ and picking up Rust. Check out my ascii-animated, optimized C++ particle simulation [here](https://github.com/jonas-scholz123/particle-simulation) or my beginner's network project in Rust [here.](https://github.com/jonas-scholz123/networks_project_rust).

:eyes: :arrow_right: :ear:Another project that I'm proud of is my *hearing images* application, in which live video data is converted to audio signals, which could function as a translater of visual information for visually impaired people. See the gif below:

You can check it out (and try it out) [here.](https://github.com/jonas-scholz123/hearing-images)
